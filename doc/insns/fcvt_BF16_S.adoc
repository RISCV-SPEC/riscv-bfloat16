[[insns-fcvt.bf16.s, Convert FP32 to BF16]]
// === FCVT.BF16.S
=== fcvt.bf16.s

Synopsis::
Convert FP32 value to a BF16 value

Mnemonic::
// FCVT.BF16.S rd, rs1
fcvt.bf16.s rd, rs1

Encoding::

[NOTE]
====
.Encoding
While the mnemonic of this instruction is consistent with that of the other RISC-V floating-point convert instructions,
a new encoding is used in bits 24:20.

`BF16.S` and `H` are used to signify that the source is FP32 and the destination is BF16.
====


Description::
Narrowing convert FP32 value to a BF16 value. Round according to the RM field.

This instruction is similar to other narrowing
floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.


Exceptions:  Overflow, Underflow, Inexact, Invalid
