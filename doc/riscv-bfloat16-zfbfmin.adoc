=== `Zfbfmin` - Scalar BF16 Converts

This extension provides the minimal set of instructions need to enable scalar support
of the BF16 format. It enables BF16 as an interchange format as it provides conversion
between BF16 values and FP32 values.

This extension requires that at least the
Minimal Half-Precision Floating-Point Standard Extension `Zfhmin`
be implemented as BF16 relies on "FLH" and "FSH" to load and store
16-bit values.
