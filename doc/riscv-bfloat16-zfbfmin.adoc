=== `Zfbfmin` - Scalar BF16 Converts

This extension provides the minimal required for scalar support of the BFloat16
format. It enables BFloat16 as an interchange format whereby it
can be used to convert between BFloat16 values and FP32 values. 

[NOTE]
====
Note the following instructions are equivalent to their Zfh counterparts where H is replaced by B and interpreted as BF16.
====

// Since BF16 has the same exponent encoding as FP32, the only exception that can occur on a conversion from BF16 to FP32 is invalid. This will only be signaled if the BF16 input is a signalling NaN.
