=== `Zfbfmin` - Scalar BF16 Converts

This extension provides the minimal set of instructions need to enable scalar support
of the BF16 format. It enables BF16 as an interchange format as it provides conversion
between BF16 values and FP32 values.

This extension requires that either the
Minimal Half-Precision Floating-Point Standard Extension `Zfhmin`
or the Half-Precision Floating-Point Standard Extension `Zfh`
is implemented as BF16 relies on "FLH" and "FSH" to load and store
16-bit floating-point values as well as FMV.X.H and FMV.H.X to move 16-bit
floating-point values to and from integer registers.
