[[zvfbfwma,Zvfbfwma]]
=== `Zvfbfwma` - Vector BF16 widening mul-add

This extension provides
a vector widening BF16 mul-add instruction that accumulates into FP32. 

// This extension depends on the "V" extension or the `Zve32f` embedded vector extension.
This extension depends on `Zvfbfmin` extension.

[NOTE]
====
The scalar load and move instructions are included so that BF16 scalar operands can be provided
for the vector-scalar `vfwmaccbf16.vf` instruction.
