=== `Zvfbfwma` - Vector BF16 widening mul-add

This extension provides
// the vector support of the BF16
// format. It provides widening BF16 mul-add and multiply instructions that produce FP32 results. 
a vector widening BF16 mul-add instruction that produces FP32 results. 

// This extension requires that either the
// Minimal Half-Precision Floating-Point Standard Extension `Zfhmin`
// or the Half-Precision Floating-Point Standard Extension `Zfh`
// is implemented as BF16 relies on `FLH` and `FSH` to load and store
// 16-bit floating-point values as well as `FMV.X.H` and `FMV.H.X` to move 16-bit
// floating-point values to and from integer registers.
